# PwC Virtual Internship - Call Center Dashboard

This repository contains the work done as part of the PwC Virtual Internship provided by Forage. The project involved creating a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize call center performance data.

## Project Overview

The task was to design and develop a Power BI dashboard that reflects relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics for a call center operation. The goal was to provide insights into various aspects of call center performance, such as customer satisfaction, call volume, agent productivity, and service quality.

## Dataset

The project used a dataset containing call center data, including information about:

- Number of calls answered and resolved
- Customer satisfaction ratings
- Average speed of answer (ASA)
- Agent performance metrics (e.g., calls handled, average handle time)
- Call topics or categories

The dataset covered a three-month period from January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2021.

## Dashboard Design

The Power BI dashboard includes the following visualizations and KPIs:

1. **Overall Customer Satisfaction**: A card visualization displaying the average customer satisfaction rating across all agents for the given period.

2. **Calls Answered and Abandoned**: A donut chart showing the percentage of calls answered and abandoned, along with the total number of calls.

3. **Call Volume by Month**: A line chart visualizing the number of calls received per month to identify peak periods or trends.

4. **Average Speed of Answer (ASA)**: A card visualization displaying the overall average speed of answer (ASA) in seconds.

5. **Agent Performance Quadrant**: A scatter plot or bubble chart representing agents' performance based on the number of calls answered and the average handle time.

6. **Calls by Topic**: A stacked bar chart illustrating the distribution of calls across different topics or categories.

7. **Agent Performance Comparison**: A table or matrix visualization comparing the performance of different agents based on metrics such as calls answered, resolved, satisfaction rating, and ASA.

8. **Filters and Slicers**: Interactive elements like filters and slicers to allow users to explore the data further and gain deeper insights.

## Dashboard Highlights

## Usage

To view and interact with the Power BI dashboard, you'll need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your machine. You can find the Power BI Desktop file (`Call enter trends.pbix`) in the `power-bi-files` folder of this repository.

## Conclusion

The PwC Virtual Internship - Call Center Dashboard project provided an opportunity to apply data visualization and analysis skills using Power BI. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of call center performance, enabling stakeholders to identify areas for improvement, optimize resource allocation, and enhance customer experience. This project showcases the ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights through effective data visualization techniques.
